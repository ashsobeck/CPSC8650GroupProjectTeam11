# CPSC 8650 Data Mining Group Project

This project aims to identify whether brain scans done by MRIs have facial features that could potentially be used to identify the patient. We are developing a tool that takes in images and will print out if it has potentially personally identifiable information.

## Our Data

Our dataset comes from Dr. Zijun Wang's research group. Using the BET and BSE tools, they produced labeled MRI images of if the image had identifiable facial features or brain tissue removed. All credit for the data goes to them. The .zip file for the data is too large to host on Github, but the link is below.

Trying to run this model will assume that you have unzipped the original zip file, as well as all of the `.gz` files for the `.nii` data

This helps us save on time spent by the script
